# Battleship ğŸš¢ğŸš¢ğŸš¢

You know the game Battleship?  Where you have a grid that you put your boat pieces on, and you take turns calling out coordinates to fire on, and the other person tells you if you hit or missed? And then the commercial always ends with "You sank my battleship!"?

My wonderful computer science prof asked us to make a Battleship game within a week, assuming a one player game where the computer randomly places the ships and you have to guess where the ships are.
